# My MVX Assement Solution

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Styled with Tailwind CSS 
Icons in this Assement were from iconsax
Select Element were made with radix UI

## External Library Choices

I went with Radix UI because option components are impossible to style becuase many browers interpreat the content diffrently. If i opted to make mine using the divs i will end up with a UI bug where the dropdown content  will not close if you click outside of it.

Tailwind was used becuase it is easy to manage and it also helps my developemnt time since i will not be moving from css / scss files and jsx files.

Iconsax was used becasue ot os the closest library i could find that fit the design

## Styles and convention

Since we opted for tailwind we used the mobile first approach for our responsivness, 
Please note : The implementation of the UI accodding to the screen size was 100% implemented, however since the desktop screen was designed for 1728px many elements where moved around at my discretion so as to maintain a great UI till I arrived at the mobile screen at 428px; The mobile was still responsive to 414px;
